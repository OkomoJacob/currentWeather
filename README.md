## Python GUI Enabled App that Reports the Current Weather Conditions of Any City in the World

#### Abstract

- This simple but powerful app asks the user to click a `GUI button` then click another `RUN` button then it displays the current weather conditions of the city.
- Good to note, the [openweathermap API](openweathermap.org) supports a time-delay of `10 mins` before they can refresh their servers to update the user of the weather data requessted for.
